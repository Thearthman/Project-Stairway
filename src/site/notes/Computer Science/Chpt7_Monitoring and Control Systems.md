# 7.01 Monitoring systems  
>[! definition]  
>**Monitoring systems** are often used to *detect* (Using [Sensors]()) when a *physical property* of a system *goes outside a desired range*. Can also be used to *record* the **condition** **of the system**.

## Sensor  
**Sensor**: are things which *measures* **physical property** of a perticular area. It can be used for the computer to percept physical world. `(For example, like a thermocouple, which outputs changing electrical voltage base on termperature.)` It *doesn't* have **built-in intellegence**, it only *outputs* an *analogue signal* for **computer** to *process*.  


# 7.02 Control Systems  
>[! definition]  
>**Control System** is the *combination* of [**Monitoring System**]() with **Actuators** and the **ablility to control the Actuators**.

>2. **Actuators** - Device to interact with surroundings. | ==*THIS IS NEW*==  
>3. **ADC** - Analogue to Digital Converter    
>4. DAC - Digital to Analogue Converter | ==*THIS IS NEW*==  
>5. **Computing Resource** (which is responsable for)  
>	1. *Data Logging*

## Feedback
When the control system *have* **Feedback**, it's called a **Closed Loop**; opposite to that, is Open Loop system.
